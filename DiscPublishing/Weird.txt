* The dcover+csv files are merged BEFORE sending the resulting image to the Primera libs. When using the primera merging capability we noticed that the behavior was undefined: the image was sometimes output and sometimes not. We worked out how the lib uses the Disc Cover 2 PE application by sending AppleScript events to it, and we now do the same. This is good, because the cover templates will be usable for other robot brands too.
* The Primera frameworks we're using are not the ones distributed in the Primera Mac SDK v. 1.2 package: these seem out of date compared to the ones included in the PTPublisher application, also downloadable from the website (to anyone, while the SDK is only available once you fill a form). The plugin works with the application-bundled frameworks.
