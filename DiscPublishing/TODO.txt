1.0.2
- Request: I see that Osirix free version burn discs but the names of DICOM files don't follow the standard of 8 characters and the name of the folder that contains the files for the web is different from IHE_PDI.
- Weasis on discs

- Customizable merge values with custom DICOM meta data

Important-ish
! treat series that don't fit on a single disc
- at start recover jobs from jobs dir
- dialog for 'Publish' button

Later...
- use NSDistributedObject instead of AppleScript
- archiving mode
- make OsiriX use new API (DicomCompressor, BurnerWindowController)

Eventually...
- Better fit algorithm
