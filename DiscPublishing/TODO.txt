TODO:
- willUnload executes SetQuitWhenDone:YES but doesn't fail if the plugin is busy publishing a disk.
- willUnload should also quit the Disc Cover PE application.

Next:
- Customizable merge values with custom DICOM meta data

Important-ish
! treat series that don't fit on a single disc
- at start recover jobs from jobs dir (we currently delete them)
- dialog for 'Publish' button

Later...
- The number of images in a study OR the number of images/studies burned on a disk
- use NSDistributedObject instead of AppleScript
- archiving mode
- make OsiriX use new API (DicomCompressor, BurnerWindowController)

Eventually...
- Better spanning algorithm (Knapsack)
