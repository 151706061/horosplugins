Known bugs:
- It seem that the index.html is not generated correctly by the DiscPublishing plugin (it's ok using the burn feature of OsiriX).
  All links to the jpeg/quicktime files are broken and directed to a folder named "tmp" in the webpage's source code.

Next:
- Customizable merge values with custom DICOM meta data

Important-ish
! treat series that don't fit on a single disc
- at start recover jobs from jobs dir
- dialog for 'Publish' button

Later...
- The number of images in a study OR the number of images/studies burned on a disk
- use NSDistributedObject instead of AppleScript
- archiving mode
- make OsiriX use new API (DicomCompressor, BurnerWindowController)

Eventually...
- Better spanning algorithm (Knapsack)
