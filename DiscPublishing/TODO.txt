TODO:
- Maybe, instead of using Growl for the notifications, we should directly send emails... Maybe we can do both.
- willUnload executes SetQuitWhenDone:YES but doesn't fail if the plugin is busy publishing a disk.
- Bender: stop robot jobs

Next:
- Customizable merge values with custom DICOM meta data

Important-ish
! treat series that don't fit on a single disc
- at start recover jobs from jobs dir (we currently delete them)
- dialog for 'Publish' button

Later...
- The number of images in a study OR the number of images/studies burned on a disk
- archiving mode
- make OsiriX use new API (DicomCompressor, BurnerWindowController)

Eventually...
- Better spanning algorithm (Knapsack)

Tried...
- Same type of media on two bins: at 2.5, the Primera framework doesn't seem to support this. It'll try one bin and complain it's empty without trying the other.
