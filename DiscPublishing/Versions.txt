1.2
- Communication between the plugin and the Tool (the program that communicates with the robot) is done through NSDistantObject instead of AppleScript.
- Fix on version 1.1.2: the DiscPublishingTool app was compiled as "32- and 64-bits Intel", and the Primera frameworks are 32-bits only.
- Upgrade to Primera SDK 2.3 beta

1.1.2 - This version was retired because it contained a bug
- Technical update: willUnload makes the tool quit, so that OsiriX plugin manager updates will succeed when rewriting over the tool's binary.

1.1.1
- Fixed disc cover merge text encoding bug
- No longer relying on dcmmkdir for DICOMDIR generation, depending on the version of OsiriX

1.1
- Upgrade to Primera SDK 2.2, which includes support for DP 4100 Series

1.0.3
- Fixes issue when robot outputs published discs on the left bin of DP Xi2
- Fixes link problem with OsiriX 3.9.4

1.0.2
- Request: I see that Osirix free version burn discs but the names of DICOM files don't follow the standard of 8 characters and the name of the folder that contains the files for the web is different from IHE_PDI.
- Weasis on discs
- Fixed a bug when choosing between DVD or CD (in some situations it always chose DVD)
