1.3.0
- OS X 10.7 and OsiriX 5.0 required
- Allows different behaviors depending on the called AET
- Option: include files by matching DICOM meta values against file ordirectory names in a mounted share
- Option: delete DICOM files after publishing them
- Support for same media in both bins

1.2.3 - This is the last version that supports OS X 10.6
- Fixes a double release bug
- Adds a security layer around tool calls (try/catch)
- Fixes an infinite loop bug when launching the publishing process without a robot

1.2.2
- Redirects OsiriX DICOM listener errors to Growl

- Added XMLRPC function 'DPPublish'

1.2.0
- Per-patient queues in the OsiriX tasks manager.
- It is now possible to cancel a parient's data publishment before it is sent to the robot. However, avoid using this too much, as it leaves a bunch of big files in the /tmp directory.
- Communication between the plugin and the Tool (the program that communicates with the robot) is done through NSDistantObject instead of AppleScript.
- Fixed issue when the Disc Cover 3 PE application wasn't found
- Fixed issue when the plugin crashed with a "index 0 out of bounds" exception (by switching to LLVM GCC)
- Upgraded Primera frameworks to versions from PTPublisher 2.3
- Primera framework dialogs are now read and distributed as a Growl notification
- Fix on version 1.1.2: the DiscPublishingTool app was compiled as "32- and 64-bits Intel", and the Primera frameworks are 32-bits only.

1.1.2 - This version was retired because it contained a bug
- Technical update: willUnload makes the tool quit, so that OsiriX plugin manager updates will succeed when rewriting over the tool's binary.

1.1.1
- Fixed disc cover merge text encoding bug
- No longer relying on dcmmkdir for DICOMDIR generation, depending on the version of OsiriX

1.1
- Upgrade to Primera SDK 2.2, which includes support for DP 4100 Series
- DICOMDIR is now generated in a cleaner way: a lot of warnings will no longer be output from dcmmkdir

1.0.3
- Fixes issue when robot outputs published discs on the left bin of DP Xi2
- Fixes link problem with OsiriX 3.9.4

1.0.2
- Request: I see that Osirix free version burn discs but the names of DICOM files don't follow the standard of 8 characters and the name of the folder that contains the files for the web is different from IHE_PDI.
- Weasis on discs
- Fixed a bug when choosing between DVD or CD (in some situations it always chose DVD)
